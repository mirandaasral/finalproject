                  "LETTERS TO is a company that seeks to reinforce the importance of the written word while
                  remaining current in the digital age. Our company provides both digital and physical stationery
                   for anyone with a love of literature. Each package is designed based on the color palette, story,
                   and mood of the corresponding classic novel. It is our goal to romanticize the act of communication
                   that we so overlook in this day and age."
